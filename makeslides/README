"makeslides" README file

Written by Chris Nandor, pudge@pobox.com.

Some additional modifications and documentation by Richard Dice,

Usage: ./makeslides [ --frames | --table ] filename.txt
Default --frames is assumed

This usage message will be displayed on STDERR if "makeslides" is invoked

    * with -h
    * with --help
    * without any command line arguments

"filename.txt" must end with ".txt".  Inspect the attached file
"tpc_2001_presentation.txt" file to see the format of file that "makeslides"
expects and requires.  It should be fairly self-explantory.  Also, RTFS
(Read The Fine Source) for more information on what kind of a file "makeslides"
expect and features it provides.

From this text file, a directory will be created, named "filename".
The contents of the filename/ directory depend on whether "makeslides" is
called with the --frames option or the --table option (or no option at all,
in which case --frames is assumed).  In all cases, the following files are
produced:

    * index.html - an introductory title page
    * toc.html   - Table of Contents page
    * styles.css - Cascading Style Sheet information

In addition to these three files, more files will be created.  In the case
of the --table option, the files will be named in the form "slide%03d.html"
and they will contain the bullet point and header information found in
"filename.txt".  If --frames was chosen, then 3 files will be created for
each section in "filename.txt":

    * slide%03d.html
    * frame_a_slide%03d.html
    * frame_b_slide%03d.html

In both of these cases, if there were any __CODE__ sections named following
an __END__ line in "filename.txt", files based on the __CODE__ sections
will be created as well.

Note that if you have a pre-existing filename/ directory, then you will 
need to delete it with "rm -rf filename/" prior to running
"./makeslides filename.txt" in order to clear it out.

Cheers,
Richard
