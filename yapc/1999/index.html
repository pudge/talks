    <H2>MacPerl and the Elements of the Wild</H2>

    <P><I>45 minute talk</I></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Perl is in some ways -- aw, who are we kidding?  in MOST ways -- out of its
element on Mac OS.  Yet, it succeeds as a useful tool for thousands of
people.  In 45 minutes, I will show you, the curious, slightly balding guy
in the front row wearing a "Linux Rules!" t-shirt and screaming "Microsoft
sucks!" in the dorms late at night, how Perl is used on the Mac.  We'll see
how MacPerl runs, we'll see how to use it to do things in Mac OS, and if we
get lucky, we'll see how to control other programs with it.  </P>

<P>And then we will all eat Pez.</P>

<P><I>
Chris Nandor 
likes moonlit walks on the beach and poetry readings.  His wife likes a
sense of humor, but married him anyway.  He is a member of <A
HREF="http://boston.pm.org/">Boston.pm</A> and spends sometimes far too
much time doing <A HREF="http://pudge.net/macperl/">MacPerl stuff</A>, but
you love him for it, and that makes it all worthwhile.
