<P>
Mac OS is a difficult OS to script, in many respects.  You can't talk
to the STDIN and STDOUT of most programs, because they don't have
STDIN or STDOUT.  So Apple came up with its own form of high-level
interapplication communication.  They developed a system for
identifying objects in an application, a protocol for communication,
an architecture for scripting languages to gain access to the whole
thing, and a scripting language over their own to make it all work
for the average user.
</P>

<P>
So now we have Apple events to talk to other programs.  They can be
called from most any language on the Mac.  AppleScript has become the
default way to do Apple events.  However -- and no offense intended
to those who disagree -- some of feel that AppleScript is an unwieldy
language that is only to be used when it has to be used; i.e., when
we need to do a lot of work with Apple events.
</P>

<P>
You see, Apple events can be spoken by most any language, but they
are so cryptic that those of us who greatly dislike AppleScript would
often rather use AppleScript than have to deal with the raw Apple
events ourselves.  The basic AppleScript might look like this:
</P>

<PRE>
    tell application "FileMaker Pro"
    	set mycells to get the second cell of (the records whose eighth cell contains "bill") of database "Check Tracker"
    end tell
</PRE>

<P>
I don't know about you, but I have been working with this stuff for
some time, and I still have trouble parsing it in my head.  It is
hard to tell what is what in AppleScript.  But consider the raw
Apple event (note that the quote marks here, and in raw forms following,
are really supposed to be curly quotes):
</P>

<PRE>
    core/getd:'----':obj {
        form:indx, want:type(ccel), seld:long(2), from:obj {
            form:test, want:type(crow), from:obj {
                form:name, want:type(cDB ), seld:"Check Tracker", from:'null'()
            },
            seld:cmpd{
                relo:cont,
                'obj1':obj {form:indx, want:type(ccel), seld:long(8), from:'exmn'()}, 
                'obj2':"bill"
            }
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>
Hm.  Um, yeah, OK.  Nasty, but this was the way you have to deal with it in
something like C or MacPerl.  You can construct it this way, or you can do
it with a functional or OO interface.  But in any event, it will be tough.
Not the way I want to spend my Saturday nights.  But I am writing this on
a Thursday evening, so:
</P>

<PRE>
    use Mac::AppleEvents;

    my $string = &lt;&lt;EOT;
    '----':obj {
        form:indx, want:type(ccel), seld:long(2), from:obj {
            form:test, want:type(crow), from:obj {
                form:name, want:type(cDB ), seld:"Check Tracker", from:'null'()
            },
            seld:cmpd{
                relo:cont,
                'obj1':obj {form:indx, want:type(ccel), seld:long(8), from:'exmn'()}, 
                'obj2':"bill"
            }
        }
    }
    EOT

    my $evt = AEBuildAppleEvent('core', 'getd', typeApplSignature,
        'FMP3', kAutoGenerateReturnID, kAnyTransactionID, $string) or die $^E;
    my $rep = AESend($evt, kAEWaitReply) or die $^E;
    my $desc = AEGetParamDesc($rep, keyDirectObject) or die $^E;
    my @data;

    if ($desc-&gt;type eq typeAEList) {
        foreach (1 .. AECountItems($desc)) {
            my $data = AEGetNthDesc($desc, $_) or die $^E;
            push @data, $data-&gt;get;
            AEDisposeDesc $data or die $^E;
        }
    } else {
        push @data, $desc-&gt;get;
    }

    AEDisposeDesc $evt or die $^E;
    AEDisposeDesc $rep or die $^E;
    AEDisposeDesc $desc or die $^E;

</PRE>

<P>
Ouchie.
</P>

<P>
So, we want a way to do Apple events that is as easy as AppleScript, but
that doesn't have all of the things we don't like about AppleScript.  In
essence, we're creating a new language, not quite AppleScript, but in
many ways based on it, using Perl.  Again, I cannot speak for everyone,
but I would much rather do this:
</P>

<PRE>
    use Mac::Glue ':glue';
    my $fmp = new Mac::Glue 'FileMaker Pro';
    my @cells = $fmp-&gt;get(
        $fmp-&gt;obj(
            cell =&gt; 2,
            records =&gt; whose(cell =&gt; 8 =&gt; contains =&gt; 'bill'),
            database =&gt; 'Check Tracker'
        )
    );
    die $^E if $^E;
</PRE>

<P>
Truth be told, it still isn't the prettiest thing.  But it is about as
good as we are going to get.  Apple event objects are complex things,
and describing them is no easy task.  But how do we get from
a functional interface with creating and disposing of descriptors or
putting together complex descriptor records in text form to the
simplistic Mac::Glue interface?
</P>

<P>
I'm glad you asked.
</P>

<P>
An application that can be controlled by Apple events is called
<EM>scriptable</EM>.  All Mac applications have a resource fork,
and all scriptable applications have an Apple Event Terminology
Extension resource (noted by the ID "aete").  It stores the
human language name for an event.  You may note that in the raw
form above, the "get" event is called "core/getd".  The get event
is "getd", and it is in the "core" suite.  We don't need to know
that as programmers, though.  That's what computers are for.
So the aete maps human language names to the computer names.
</P>

<P>
It does more than just map event names.  It notes what various
parameters an event may accept, and what data types each parameter
expects (yes, we need to worry about data types with Apple events ...
but this is Perl, so Mac::Glue tries to hide the details of that
whenever possible).  It also identifies classes, with their human
language names and IDs.  In the above example, "cell", "records",
and "database" are all class names.
</P>

<P>
An application is simply dropped on a special MacPerl droplet,
and the applications' aete resource is parsed and saved as
a persistent Perl data structure, as a "glue".  Then it can
be called in the <TT>Mac::Glue-&gt;new</TT> constructor, and
the application can be scripted with simplicity matching that
of AppleScript.
</P>

<P>
I won't bore you with all of the gory details of how
Mac::Glue is implemented.  The source is available, of course,
and if you are interested you can read it.  Basically, you
create an object instance, and call events as object methods,
passing in parameters and their values as key/value pairs
(except for the direct object parameter value, which, if present,
is passed first, with no key).
</P>

<P>
The value of each key is either a simple data type or an object
specifier record, created with the <TT>obj</TT> method.  The method
call returns whatever data the event returns, and any error
is put into <TT>$^E</TT> (which works like <TT>$!</TT>).
</P>

<P>
An object specifier
record consists, in simple terms, of a series of key/value
pairs, where each pair contains the one preceding it
(such as in "cell =&gt; 1, record =&gt; 2, database =&gt; 'Foo'").
The value of each key can be many different things, like
a logical test, a range, an index, a name,
or an insertion location.  Some of these are specified
using special functions (like <TT>whose()</TT> and
<TT>range()</TT>), others are specified using simple data,
and Mac::Glue guesses as to what it should be.  Regular text
is assumed to be a name, and numbers are assumed to be
numeric indexes.  There is also a function to specify data
types and forms.  In most cases, Mac::Glue will do all the work.
</P>

<P>
Mac::Glue does its best to make things as perlish as possible.
For instance, Apple events have data structures called
records and lists, which correspond to Perl hashes and arrays.
So, passing an anonymous array or hash (or any arbitrarily nested
combination) is converted into the corresponding Apple event
data structures.  Same thing goes when they are returned back,
too.
</P>

<PRE>
    $app-&gt;make(new =&gt; window =&gt; with_properties =&gt;
        {name =&gt; "Foo", position =&gt; [300, 100]}
    );
</PRE>

<P>
<B>NB:</B> Oddly enough (or not), Apple event lists use
brackets as Perl anonymous arrays do, and Apple event records
use braces as Perl anonymous hashes do.  AppleScript uses braces
for records, but can use brackets or braces for lists.
But I digress.
</P>

<P>
There's quite a bit going on in that event call.  First,
Mac::Glue determines that the "make" event corresponds
to the application's "core/crel" event.  It notes that
the "new" parameter has the ID "kocl", and "with_properties"
is "prdt".  The "kocl" parameter asks for a type, so
it looks to see if "window" is a type, and indeed it is:
its ID is "cwin".  It converts the value of the 
"prdt" parameter to an Apple event data structure, looking
up the values for the name ("pnam") and position ("ppos")
parameters.  The value for "pnam" is a text value, so it
is added as a character data type.  Then it puts the anonymous
array <TT>[300, 100]</TT> (with each value as an integer data type)
into an Apple event list with the same values.
</P>

<P>
Whew!  We don't want to think about all of that, though.  At least,
I don't.  Again, you might like that kind of thing.  You might
prefer this (which doesn't look so bad after reading
the previous paragraph):
</P>

<PRE>
    core/crel: kocl:type(cwin), prdt:{pnam:"Foo", ppos:[300, 100]}
</PRE>

<P>
But I don't think you prefer that.  And I am never, evr, wrong.
</P>

<P>
There are other things Mac::Glue does for you.  Of course, it converts
the data structures, it creates events, adds parameters, sends them,
and checks for errors (and puts them into <TT>$^E</TT>).
It's also pretty good at coercing data types automatically.
For instance, a 1 or 0 is converted to Apple event booleans
if a boolean data type is requested by a parameter.
If an alias is called for, and a file path is passed, it will be
converted to an alias with <TT>Mac::Files::NewAliasMinimal()</TT>.
FSSpecs are similarly converted.  And of course, on return they
are converted back into file paths.  Text types like international
and styled text are coerced into regular text on return.
</P>

<P>
The programmer can have as much control as he wants, too, as the complete,
raw, Mac::AppleEvents functions and constants are available
via the <TT>:all</TT> import tag.  And by using the <TT>RETOBJ</TT> method
or event parameter, the programmer can get access to the complete Apple event
and reply descriptors, and can munge the data however he likes.
</P>

<P>
Mac::Glue is still in development, but is moving rapidly toward a beta
release, and its basic feature set is nearing completion.  More
information is always available from my MacPerl site at
