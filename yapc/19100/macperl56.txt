Me
	* Work on Slash code
	* Been using MacPerl extensively since 1996
	* Co-authored "MacPerl: Power and Ease"
	* Author of several MacPerl modules
	* Help with MacPerl porting

(Previous) Steps to Build MacPerl
	* Be Matthias Neeracher
	* Port required pieces
	* Edit Perl sources to work on the Mac
	* Write and build POSIX library (GUSI)
	* Using expensive, proprietary compilers, build
		command-line tools (miniperl and perl) for MPW,
		perl and MacPerl extensions, and MacPerl application

How To Be Matthias Neeracher
	* Port GNU Awk to Mac OS in 1990
	* Start work on port of Perl during compulsory basic
		training in Swiss army in summer 1991
	* Port patch and dmake
	* Port SFIO, Berkeley DB
	* Write socket/POSIX libraries

Here, Little Piggy
	* GUSI stands for Grand Unified Socket Interface
	* A "gusi" is a piglet in the Bernese dialect of Swiss German
	* GUSI was originally for emulating BSD sockets on Mac OS,
		but has evolved into a general-purpose POSIX
		emulation library
	* MacPerl 5.6 will be the first to use GUSI 2, which
		introduces POSIX threads and some previously
		unimplemented functions (e.g., socketpair)

Perl Sources
	* Paths in Makefiles, etc.; File::Spec used in more places
	* defines (<TT>MACOS_TRADITIONAL</TT>)
	* xsubpp changes and additions (some experimental)
	* In .c files, bunches of small Mac-specific changes,
		like retrieving of Mac errors for <TT>$^E</TT>
		(<TT>gMacPerl_OSErr</TT>), switch handling
		(-u, -e, etc.), filespecs
	* Amount of changes about the same as for any other port,
		like VMS, DOS, etc.
	* Previously was separate source; currently, integrating
		patches for MacPerl into the main perl source

Compilers
	* Previously only used Metrowerks CodeWarrior compilers
		for MPW, with builds for 68K, CFM68K, PPC
	* CFM68K is for 68K Macs that use Code Fragment Manager
		(allows dynamic loading)
	* MWC compilers proprietary and expensive
	* Now use Apple and Metrowerks CodeWarrior, 68K and PPC <PRE>
	+-------+----------+----------+
	|       |  68K     |  PPC     |
	+-------+----------+----------+
	| Apple |  SC      |  MrC     |
	+-------+----------+----------+
	| MWC   |  MWC68K  |  MWCPPC  |
	+-------+----------+----------+

	* Apple compilers are proprietary and freely available
	* Metrowerks compilers are essentially better
	* Apple compilers build larger (slower ???) binaries

Threads & Fork
	* Single process with multiple threads (5005threads?)
	* Multiple "applications" in a single process (ithreads?)
	* Mac OS only allows one instance of a given "physical"
		application to run at a time
	* LWP/HWT (light-weight process, heavy-weight thread):
		threads with their own fd table and sfio environment
	* "Win32" fork() emulation
	* Details very sketchy right now
	* Another possibility: MacPerl shared library could be accessed
		by multiple smaller processes, so multiple
		simultaneous perl programs could run

Testing
	* First, port the test suite itself
	* Require path changes, etc.
	* Uncover bugs, fix bugs, test again

	
Modules
	* Some already ported
	* Some need no porting
	* Some run now, but new features (like qr//) mean new
		porting/testing done again
	* Some cannot be ported until MacPerl 5.6 is "done"
	* Some cannot be ported until other modules are ported
		which cnanot be done until MacPerl 5.6 is
		"done"
