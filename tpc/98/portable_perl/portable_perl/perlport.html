perlport - Writing portable Perl


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
Perl runs on a variety of operating systems. While most of them share a lot
in common, they also have their own very particular and unique features.


<P>

This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes portable
perl code, so that once you have made your decision to write portably, you
know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them.


<P>

There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of <STRONG>a</STRONG> particular type of computer, and taking advantage of a full <STRONG>range</STRONG> of them. Naturally, as you make your range bigger (and thus more diverse),
the common denominators drop, and you are left with fewer areas of common
ground in which you can operate to accomplish a particular task. Thus, when
you begin attacking a problem, it is important to consider which part of
the tradeoff curve you want to operate under. Specifically, whether it is
important to you that the task that you are coding needs the full
generality of being portable, or if it is sufficient to just get the job
done. This is the hardest choice to be made. The rest is easy, because Perl
provides lots of choices, whichever way you want to approach your problem.


<P>

Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about willfully
limiting your available choices. Naturally, it takes discipline to do that.


<P>

Be aware of two important points:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Not">Not all Perl programs have to be portable

</A></STRONG><DD>
There is no reason why you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix
tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh application, or to manage the
Windows registry. If it makes no sense to aim for portability for one
reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_The">The vast majority of Perl is portable

</A></STRONG><DD>
Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl code.
It isn't. Perl tries its level-best to bridge the gaps between what's
available on different platforms, and all the means available to use those
features. Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine without
modification. But there <EM>are</EM> some significant issues in writing portable code, and this document is
entirely about those issues.


<P>

</DL>
Here's the general rule: When you approach a task that is commonly done
using a whole range of platforms, think in terms of writing portable code.
That way, you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation choices you
can avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give your users lots of
platform choices. On the other hand, when you have to take advantage of
some unique feature of a particular platform, as is often the case with
systems programming (whether for Unix, Windows,
Mac&nbsp;OS, VMS, etc.), consider writing platform-specific code.


<P>

When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, then you may
only need to consider the differences of those particular systems. The
important thing is to decide where the code will run, and to be deliberate
in your decision.


<P>

This information should not be considered complete; it includes possibly
transient information about idiosyncracies of some of the ports, almost all
of which are in a state of constant evolution. Thus this material should be
considered a perpetual work in progress (&lt;IMG SRC=``yellow_sign.gif'' ALT=``Under Construction''&gt;).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="ISSUES">ISSUES

</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Newlines">Newlines

</A></H2>
In most operating systems, lines in files are separated with newlines. Just
what is used as a newline may vary from OS to OS. Unix traditionally uses <CODE>\012</CODE>, one kind of Windows I/O uses <CODE>\015\012</CODE>, and Mac&nbsp;OS uses <CODE>\015</CODE>.


<P>

Perl uses <CODE>\n</CODE> to represent the ``logical'' newline, where what is logical may depend on
the platform in use. In MacPerl, <CODE>\n</CODE>
always means <CODE>\015</CODE>. In DOSish perls, <CODE>\n</CODE> usually means <CODE>\012</CODE>, but when accessing a file in ``text'' mode, STDIO translates it to (or
from)
<CODE>\015\012</CODE>.


<P>

Due to the ``text'' mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations of
using <CODE>seek</CODE> and <CODE>tell</CODE> when a file is being accessed in ``text'' mode. Specifically, if you stick
to <CODE>seek</CODE>-ing to locations you got from <CODE>tell</CODE> (and no others), you are usually free to use <CODE>seek</CODE> and
<CODE>tell</CODE> even in ``text'' mode. In general, using <CODE>seek</CODE> or <CODE>tell</CODE> or other file operations that count bytes instead of characters, without
considering the length of <CODE>\n</CODE>, may be non-portable. If you use
<A HREF="#item_binmode">binmode</A> on a file, however, you can usually use <CODE>seek</CODE> and <CODE>tell</CODE>
with arbitrary values quite safely.


<P>

A common misconception in socket programming is that <CODE>\n</CODE> eq <CODE>\012</CODE>
everywhere. When using protocols, such as common Internet protocols,
<CODE>\012</CODE> and <CODE>\015</CODE> are called for specifically, and the values of the logical <CODE>\n</CODE> and <CODE>\r</CODE> (carriage return) are not reliable.


<P>

<PRE>    print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client!\r\n&quot;;      # WRONG
    print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client!\015\012&quot;;  # RIGHT
</PRE>

<P>

[NOTE: this does not necessarily apply to communications that are filtered
by another program or module before sending to the socket; the the most
popular EBCDIC webserver, for instance, accepts <CODE>\r\n</CODE>, which translates those characters, along with all other characters in
text streams, from EBCDIC to ASCII.]


<P>

However, <CODE>\015\012</CODE> (or <CODE>\cM\cJ</CODE>, or <CODE>\x0D\x0A</CODE>) can be tedious and unsightly, as well as confusing to those maintaining
the code. As such, the <CODE>Socket</CODE> module supplies the Right Thing for those who want it.


<P>

<PRE>    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client!$CRLF&quot;      # RIGHT
</PRE>

<P>

When reading <EM>from</EM> a socket, remember that the default input record separator (<CODE>$/</CODE>) is <CODE>\n</CODE>, but code like this should recognize <CODE>$/</CODE> as
<CODE>\012</CODE> or <CODE>\015\012</CODE>:


<P>

<PRE>    while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) {
        # ...
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Better:


<P>

<PRE>    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \012
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) {
        s/$CR?$LF/\n/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
    #   s/\015?\012/\n/; # same thing
    }
</PRE>

<P>

And this example is actually better than the previous one even for Unix
platforms, because now any <CODE>\015</CODE>'s (<CODE>\cM</CODE>'s) are stripped out (and there was much rejoicing).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="File_Paths">File Paths

</A></H2>
Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical fashion. So, it
is reasonably safe to assume that any platform supports the notion of a
``path'' to uniquely identify a file on the system. Just how that path is
actually written, differs.


<P>

While they are similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
Windows, Mac&nbsp;OS, OS/2, VMS and probably others. Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes
that has the idea of a root directory.  Mac&nbsp;OS
uses <CODE>:</CODE> as a path separator instead of <CODE>/</CODE>. VMS, Windows, and OS/2 can work similarly to Unix with <CODE>/</CODE> as path separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways.


<P>

As with the newline problem above, there are modules that can help. The
<CODE>File::Spec</CODE> modules provide methods to do the Right Thing on whatever platform happens
to be running the program.


<P>

<PRE>    use File::Spec;
    chdir(File::Spec-&gt;updir());        # go up one directory
    $file = File::Spec-&gt;catfile(
        File::Spec-&gt;curdir(), 'temp', 'file.txt'
    );
    # on Unix and Win32, './temp/file.txt'
    # on Mac OS, ':temp:file.txt'
</PRE>

<P>

File::Spec is available in the standard distribution, as of version
5.004_05.


<P>

In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded; making
them user supplied or from a configuration file is better, keeping in mind
that file path syntax varies on different machines.


<P>

This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test suites,
which often assume <CODE>/</CODE> as a path separator for subdirectories.


<P>

Also of use is <CODE>File::Basename</CODE>, from the standard distribution, which splits a pathname into pieces (base
filename, full path to directory, and file suffix).


<P>

Remember not to count on the existence of system-specific files, like 
<EM>/etc/resolv.conf</EM>. If code does need to rely on such a file, include a description of the
file and its format in the code's documentation, and make it easy for the
user to override the default location of the file.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="System_Interaction">System Interaction

</A></H2>
Not all platforms provide for the notion of a command line, necessarily.
These are usually platforms that rely on a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
for user interaction. So a program requiring command lines might not work
everywhere. But this is probably for the user of the program to deal with.


<P>

Some platforms can't delete or rename files that are being held open by the
system. Remember to <CODE>close</CODE> files when you are done with them. Don't <CODE>unlink</CODE> or <CODE>rename</CODE> an open file. Don't <CODE>tie</CODE> to or <A HREF="#item_open">open</A> a file that is already tied to or opened; <CODE>untie</CODE> or <CODE>close</CODE> first.


<P>

Don't count on a specific environment variable existing in <CODE>%ENV</CODE>. Don't even count on <CODE>%ENV</CODE> entries being case-sensitive, or even case-preserving.


<P>

Don't count on signals in portable programs.


<P>

Don't count on filename globbing. Use <CODE>opendir</CODE>, <CODE>readdir</CODE>, and 
<CODE>closedir</CODE> instead.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Interprocess_Communication_IPC_">Interprocess Communication (IPC)

</A></H2>
In general, don't directly access the system in code that is meant to be
portable. That means, no: <A HREF="#item_system">system</A>, <A HREF="#item_exec">exec</A>, <A HREF="#item_fork">fork</A>, <A HREF="#item_pipe">pipe</A>, <CODE>``</CODE>,
<CODE>qx//</CODE>, <A HREF="#item_open">open</A> with a <CODE>|</CODE>, or any of the other things that makes being a Unix perl hacker worth
being.


<P>

Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on most
platforms (though many of them do not support any type of forking), but the
problem with using them arises from what you invoke with them. External
tools are often named differently on different platforms, often not
available in the same location, often accept different arguments, often
behave differently, and often represent their results in a
platform-dependent way. Thus you should seldom depend on them to produce
consistent results.


<P>

One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to sendmail:


<P>

<PRE>    open(MAIL, '|/usr/lib/sendmail -t') or die $!;
</PRE>

<P>

This is fine for systems programming when sendmail is known to be
available. But it is not fine for many non-Unix systems, and even some Unix
systems that may not have sendmail installed. If a portable solution is
needed, see the <CODE>Mail::Send</CODE> and <CODE>Mail::Mailer</CODE> modules in the <CODE>MailTools</CODE> distribution.  <CODE>Mail::Mailer</CODE> provides several mailing methods, including mail, sendmail, and direct SMTP
(via <CODE>Net::SMTP</CODE>) if a mail transfer agent is not available.


<P>

The rule of thumb for portable code is: Do it all in portable Perl, or use
a module that may internally implement it with platform-specific code, but
expose a common interface. By portable Perl, we mean code that avoids the
constructs described in this document as being non-portable.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="External_Subroutines_XS_">External Subroutines (XS)

</A></H2>
XS code, in general, can be made to work with any platform; but dependent
libraries, header files, etc., might not be readily available or portable,
or the XS code itself might be platform-specific, just as Perl code might
be. If the libraries and headers are portable, then it is normally
reasonable to make sure the XS code is portable, too.


<P>

There is a different kind of portability issue with writing XS code:
availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system. C brings with it its
own portability issues, and writing XS code will expose you to some of
those. Writing purely in perl is a comparatively easier way to achieve
portability.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Standard_Modules">Standard Modules

</A></H2>
In general, the standard modules work across platforms. Notable exceptions
are <CODE>CPAN.pm</CODE> (which currently makes connections to external programs that may not be
available), platform-specific modules (like
<CODE>ExtUtils::MM_VMS</CODE>), and DBM modules.


<P>

There is no one DBM module that is available on all platforms.
<CODE>SDBM_File</CODE> and the others are generally available on all Unix and DOSish ports, but
not in MacPerl, where <CODE>NBDM_File</CODE> and <CODE>DB_File</CODE> are available.


<P>

The good news is that at least some DBM module should be available, and
<CODE>AnyDBM_File</CODE> will use whichever module it can find. Of course, then the code needs to be
fairly strict, dropping to the lowest common denominator (e.g., not
exceeding 1K for each record).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Time_and_Date">Time and Date

</A></H2>
The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled in
widely different ways. Don't assume the timezone is stored in <CODE>$ENV{TZ}</CODE>, and even if it is, don't assume that you can control the timezone through
that variable.


<P>

Don't assume that the epoch starts at January 1, 1970, because that is
OS-specific. Better to store a date in an unambiguous representation. A
text representation (like <CODE>1 Jan 1970</CODE>) can be easily converted into an OS-specific value using a module like <CODE>Date::Parse</CODE>. An array of values, such as those returned by <CODE>localtime</CODE>, can be converted to an OS-specific representation using <CODE>Time::Local</CODE>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="System_Resources">System Resources

</A></H2>
If your code is destined for systems with severely constrained (or
missing!) virtual memory systems then you want to be especially mindful of
avoiding wasteful constructs such as:


<P>

<PRE>    # NOTE: this is no longer &quot;bad&quot; in perl5.005
    for (0..10000000) {}                       # bad
    for (my $x = 0; $x &lt;= 10000000; ++$x) {}   # good
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    @lines = &lt;VERY_LARGE_FILE&gt;;                # bad
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {$file .= $_}               # sometimes bad
    $file = join '', &lt;FILE&gt;;                   # better
</PRE>

<P>

The last two may appear unintuitive to most people. The first of those two
constructs repeatedly grows a string, while the second allocates a large
chunk of memory in one go. On some systems, the latter is more efficient
that the former.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Security">Security

</A></H2>
Most Unix platforms provide basic levels of security that is usually felt
at the file-system level. Other platforms usually don't (unfortunately).
Thus the notion of User-ID, or ``home'' directory, or even the state of
being logged-in may be unrecognizable on may platforms. If you write
programs that are security conscious, it is usually best to know what type
of system you will be operating under, and write code explicitly for that
platform (or class of platforms).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Style">Style

</A></H2>
For those times when it is necessary to have platform-specific code,
consider keeping the platform-specific code in one place, making porting to
other platforms easier. Use the <CODE>Config</CODE> module and the special variable <CODE>$^O</CODE> to differentiate platforms, as described in <A HREF="#PLATFORMS">PLATFORMS</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="CPAN_TESTERS">CPAN TESTERS

</A></H1>
Module uploaded to CPAN are tested by a variety of volunteers on different
platforms. These CPAN testers are notified by e-mail of each new upload,
and reply to the list with PASS, FAIL, NA (not applicable to this
platform), or ???? (unknown), along with any relevant notations.


<P>

The purpose of the testing is twofold: one, to help developers fix any
problems in their code; two, to provide users with information about
whether or not a given module works on a given platform.

As of version 5.002, Perl is built with a <CODE>$^O</CODE> variable that indicates the operating system it was built on. This was
implemented to help speed up code that would otherwise have to <CODE>use Config;</CODE> and use the value of <CODE>$Config{'osname'}</CODE>. Of course, to get detailed information about the system, looking into <CODE>%Config</CODE> is certainly recommended.

<H2><A NAME="Unix">Unix

Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms (see
e.g. most of the files in the <EM>hints/</EM> directory in the source code kit). On most of these systems, the value of <CODE>$^O</CODE> (hence <CODE>$Config{'osname'}</CODE>, too) is determined by lowercasing and stripping punctuation from the
first field of the string returned by typing


<P>

<PRE>    % uname -a

<P>

(or a similar command) at the shell prompt. Here, for example, are a few of
the more popular Unix flavors:

<H2><A NAME="DOS_and_Derivatives">DOS and Derivatives

</A></H2>
Perl has long been ported to PC style microcomputers running under systems
like PC-DOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and most Windows platforms you can bring
yourself to mention (except for Windows CE, if you count that). Users
familiar with <EM>COMMAND.COM</EM> and/or <EM>CMD.EXE</EM> style shells should be aware that each of these file specifications may
have subtle differences:


<P>

<PRE>    $filespec0 = &quot;c:/foo/bar/file.txt&quot;;
    $filespec1 = &quot;c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt&quot;;
    $filespec2 = 'c:\foo\bar\file.txt';
    $filespec3 = 'c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt';
</PRE>

<P>

System calls accept either <CODE>/</CODE> or <CODE>\</CODE> as the path separator. However, many command-line utilities of DOS vintage
treat <CODE>/</CODE> as the option prefix, so they may get confused by filenames containing <CODE>/</CODE>. Aside from calling any external programs, <CODE>/</CODE> will work just fine, and probably better, as it is more consistent with
popular usage, and avoids the problem of remembering what to backwhack and
what not to.


<P>

The DOS FAT file system can only accomodate ``8.3'' style filenames. Under
the ``case insensitive, but case preserving'' HPFS (OS/2) and NTFS (NT)
file systems you may have to be careful about case returned with functions
like <CODE>readdir</CODE> or used with functions like <A HREF="#item_open">open</A> or <CODE>opendir</CODE>.


<P>

DOS also treats several filenames as special, such as AUX, PRN, NUL, CON,
COM1, LPT1, LPT2 etc. Unfortunately these filenames won't even work if you
include an explicit directory prefix, in some cases. It is best to avoid
such filenames, if you want your code to be portable to DOS and its
derivatives.


<P>

Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of scripts such
as <EM>pl2bat.bat</EM> or <EM>pl2cmd</EM> as appropriate to put wrappers around your scripts.


<P>

Newline (<CODE>\n</CODE>) is translated as <CODE>\015\012</CODE> by STDIO when reading from and writing to files.  <A HREF="#item_binmode">binmode(FILEHANDLE)</A> will keep <CODE>\n</CODE> translated as <CODE>\012</CODE> for that filehandle. Since it is a noop on other systems,
<A HREF="#item_binmode">binmode</A> should be used for cross-platform code that deals with binary data.


<P>

The <CODE>$^O</CODE> variable and the <CODE>$Config{'archname'}</CODE> values for various DOSish perls are as follows:

Any module requiring XS compilation is right out for most people, because
MacPerl is built using non-free (and non-cheap!) compilers. Some XS modules
that can work with MacPerl are built and distributed in binary form on

<P>

In the MacPerl application, you can't run a program from the command line;
programs that expect <CODE>@ARGV</CODE> to be populated can be edited with something like the following, which

Mac users can use programs on a kind of command line under MPW (Macintosh
Programmer's Workshop, a free development environment from Apple). MacPerl
was first introduced as an MPW tool, and MPW can be used like a shell:


<P>

<PRE>    perl myscript.plx some arguments
</PRE>

<P>

ToolServer is another app from Apple that provides access to MPW tools from
MPW and the MacPerl app, which allows MacPerl program to use 
<A HREF="#item_system">system</A>, backticks, and piped <A HREF="#item_open">open</A>.


<P>

``Mac&nbsp;OS'' is the proper name for the operating system, but the value in <CODE>$^O</CODE> is ``MacOS''. To determine architecture, version, or whether the
application or MPW tool version is running, check:


<P>

<PRE>    $is_app    = $MacPerl::Version =~ /App/;
    $is_tool   = $MacPerl::Version =~ /MPW/;
    ($version) = $MacPerl::Version =~ /^(\S+)/;
    $is_ppc    = $MacPerl::Architecture eq 'MacPPC';
    $is_68k    = $MacPerl::Architecture eq 'Mac68K';
</PRE>

Perl on VMS is discussed in <EM>vms/perlvms.pod</EM> in the perl distribution. Note that perl on VMS can accept either VMS or
Unix style file specifications as in either of the following:


<P>

<PRE>    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; /sys$login/login.com
</PRE>

<P>

but not a mixture of both as in:


<P>

<PRE>    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; sys$login:/login.com
    Can't open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error
</PRE>

<P>

Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (DCL) shell often
requires a different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do. For
example:


<P>

<PRE>    $ perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello, world.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
    Hello, world.
</PRE>

<P>

There are a number of ways to wrap your perl scripts in DCL .COM files if
you are so inclined. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    $ write sys$output &quot;Hello from DCL!&quot;
    $ if p1 .eqs. &quot;&quot;
    $ then perl -x 'f$environment(&quot;PROCEDURE&quot;)
    $ else perl -x - 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
    $ deck/dollars=&quot;__END__&quot;
    #!/usr/bin/perl
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    print &quot;Hello from Perl!\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    __END__
    $ endif
</PRE>

<P>

Do take care with <CODE>$ ASSIGN/nolog/user SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT</CODE> if your perl-in-DCL script expects to do things like <CODE>$read = &lt;STDIN&gt;;</CODE>.


<P>

Filenames are in the format ``name.extension;version''. The maximum length
for filenames is 39 characters, and the maximum length for extensions is
also 39 characters. Version is a number from 1 to 32767. Valid characters
are <CODE>/[A-Z0-9$_-]/</CODE>.


<P>

VMS' RMS filesystem is case insensitive and does not preserve case.
<CODE>readdir</CODE> returns lowercased filenames, but specifying a file for opening remains
case insensitive. Files without extensions have a trailing period on them,
so doing a <CODE>readdir</CODE> with a file named <EM>A.;5</EM>
will return <EM>a.</EM> (though that file could be opened with <A HREF="#item_open">open(FH, 'A')</A>.


<P>

RMS has an eight level limit on directory depths from any rooted logical
(allowing 16 levels overall). Hence <CODE>PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]</CODE>
is a valid directory specification but <CODE>PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]</CODE>
is not.  <EM>Makefile.PL</EM> authors might have to take this into account, but at least they can refer
to the former as <CODE>/PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/</CODE>.


<P>

The <CODE>VMS::Filespec</CODE> module, which gets installed as part of the build process on VMS, is a pure
Perl module that can easily be installed on non-VMS platforms and can be
helpful for conversions to and from RMS native formats.


<P>

What <CODE>\n</CODE> represents depends on the type of file that is open. It could be <CODE>\015</CODE>, <CODE>\012</CODE>, <CODE>\015\012</CODE>, or nothing. Reading from a file translates newlines to <CODE>\012</CODE>, unless <A HREF="#item_binmode">binmode</A> was executed on that handle, just like DOSish perls.


<P>

TCP/IP stacks are optional on VMS, so socket routines might not be
implemented. UDP sockets may not be supported.


<P>

The value of <CODE>$^O</CODE> on OpenVMS is ``VMS''. To determine the architecture that you are running
on without resorting to loading all of <CODE>%Config</CODE>
you can examine the content of the <CODE>@INC</CODE> array like so:


<P>

<PRE>    if (grep(/VMS_AXP/, @INC)) { 
        print &quot;I'm on Alpha!\n&quot;;
    } elsif (grep(/VMS_VAX/, @INC)) {
        print &quot;I'm on VAX!\n&quot;;
    } else {
        print &quot;I'm not so sure about where $^O is...\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="EBCDIC_Platforms">EBCDIC Platforms

</A></H2>
Recent versions of Perl have been ported to platforms such as OS/400 on
AS/400 minicomputers as well as OS/390 for IBM Mainframes. Such computers
use EBCDIC character sets internally (usually Character Code Set ID 00819
for OS/400 and IBM-1047 for OS/390). Note that on the mainframe perl
currently works under the ``Unix system services for OS/390'' (formerly
known as OpenEdition).


<P>

As of R2.5 of USS for OS/390 that Unix sub-system did not support the 
<CODE>#!</CODE> shebang trick for script invocation. Hence, on OS/390 perl scripts can
executed with a header similar to the following simple script:


<P>

<PRE>    : # use perl
        eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
            if 0;
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    print &quot;Hello from perl!\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

On these platforms, bear in mind that the EBCDIC character set may have an
effect on what happens with perl functions such as <CODE>chr</CODE>, <CODE>pack</CODE>,
<CODE>print</CODE>, <CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>ord</CODE>, <CODE>sort</CODE>, <CODE>sprintf</CODE>, <CODE>unpack</CODE>; as well as bit-fiddling with ASCII constants using operators like <CODE>^</CODE>, <CODE>&</CODE> and
<CODE>|</CODE>; not to mention dealing with socket interfaces to ASCII computers (see <A HREF="#NEWLINES">NEWLINES</A>).


<P>

Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly translate
the <CODE>\n</CODE> in the following statement to its ASCII equivalent (note that
<CODE>\r</CODE> is the same under both ASCII and EBCDIC):


<P>

<PRE>    print &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

The value of <CODE>$^O</CODE> on OS/390 is ``os390''.  


<P>

Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an EBCDIC platform
could include any of the following (perhaps all):


<P>

<PRE>    if (&quot;\t&quot; eq &quot;\05&quot;)   { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    if (ord('A') == 193) { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    if (chr(169) eq 'z') { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }
</PRE>

<P>

Note that one thing you may not want to rely on is the EBCDIC encoding of
punctuation characters since these may differ from code page to code page
(and once your module or script is rumoured to work with EBCDIC, folks will
want it to work with all EBCDIC character sets).

Perl has been ported to a variety of platforms that do not fit into any of

been well integrated into the standard Perl source code kit. You may need
to see the <EM>ports/</EM> directory on CPAN for information, and possibly binaries, for the likes of:
acorn, aos, atari, lynxos, HP-MPE/iX, riscos, Tandem Guardian, vos, <EM>etc.</EM> (yes we know that some of these OSes may fall under the Unix category but

<P>

The list may very well be incomplete, or wrong in some places. When in
doubt, consult the platform-specific README files in the Perl source
distribution, and other documentation resources for a given port.

Be aware, moreover, that even among Unix-ish systems there are variations,
and not all functions listed here are necessarily available, though most
usually are.

For many functions, you can also query <CODE>%Config</CODE>, exported by default from <CODE>Config.pm</CODE>. For example, to check if the platform has the <A HREF="#item_lstat">lstat</A>

mtime and atime are the same thing, and ctime is creation time instead of
inode change time. (Mac&nbsp;OS)


<P>

device and inode are not meaningful. (Win32)


<P>

device and inode are not necessarily reliable. (VMS)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_symlink">symlink OLDFILE,NEWFILE

</A></STRONG><DD>
Not implemented. (Win32, VMS)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_syscall">syscall LIST

</A></STRONG><DD>
Not implemented. (Mac&nbsp;OS, Win32, VMS)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_system">system LIST

</A></STRONG><DD>
Only implemented if ToolServer is installed. (Mac&nbsp;OS)


<P>

As an optimization, may not call the command shell specified in
<CODE>$ENV{PERL5SHELL}</CODE>. <A HREF="#item_system">system(1, @args)</A> spawns an external process and immediately returns its process designator,
without waiting for it to terminate. Return value may be used subsequently
in <A HREF="#item_wait">wait</A> or <A HREF="#item_waitpid">waitpid</A>. (Win32)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_times">times

</A></STRONG><DD>
Only the first entry returned is nonzero. (Mac&nbsp;OS)


<P>

``cumulative'' times will be bogus. On anything other than Windows NT,
``system'' time will be bogus, and ``user'' time is actually the time
returned by the <CODE>clock()</CODE> function in the C runtime library.
(Win32)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_truncate">truncate FILEHANDLE,LENGTH

</A></STRONG><DD>
<DT><STRONG>truncate EXPR,LENGTH

</A></STRONG><DD>
Not implemented. (VMS)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_umask">umask EXPR

</A></STRONG><DD>
<DT><STRONG>umask

</A></STRONG><DD>
Returns undef where unavailable, as of version 5.005.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_utime">utime LIST

</A></STRONG><DD>
Only the modification time is updated. (Mac&nbsp;OS, VMS)


<P>

May not behave as expected. (Win32)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_wait">wait

</A></STRONG><DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_waitpid">waitpid PID,FLAGS

</A></STRONG><DD>
Not implemented. (Mac&nbsp;OS)


<P>

Can only be applied to process handles returned for processes spawned using <A HREF="#item_system">system(1, ...)</A>. (Win32)
