Me
	* Work on Slash code for Andover.Net / VA Linux
	* Been using MacPerl extensively since 1996
	* Co-authored "MacPerl: Power and Ease"
	* Author of several MacPerl modules
	* Help with MacPerl porting

You
	* Use a Mac
	* Know Perl
	* Want to be really cool

A Few Short Steps to Coolness
	* (see previous slide)
	* Learn the [tT]oolbox (Mac:: modules, CPAN, your Mac
		applications, AppleScript)
	* Find a task you want accomplished
	* Discover how to do it
	* Do it

Laziness
	* Or maybe find a task that needs accomplishing
		that you don't want to have to accomplish
		manually
	* I don't want to click on a half dozen apps every morning
		to start them up
	* I don't want to change all of my settings every time
		I go to work or come home
	* I don't want to compare all of these files by hand
	* I don't want to have to think to surf the web

Impatience
	* Or maybe find a task that you want done more quickly
	* I want to find a URL I went to recently
	* I want to edit the web page I am looking at
	* I want to call a "compiled" MacPerl script, not a
		compiled AppleScript

Hubris
	* Or maybe find a task that doesn't really need to be
		done at all, but doing it in MacPerl will
		<EM>really</EM> make you look cool
	* Write a game
	* Play movies or MP3s
	* Sing
